Smll TODOS:
1. In solution, instead of "[Max Assumptions: 4]" need to print "[Max Assumptions Level: 4]" or "[Max Depth of Assumptions: 4]"
   Verify before proceeding.
2. From the statustip of the buttons and labels, remove the shortcut information, since shortcuts dont work

Big TODOS:
1. Do analysis of algorithm complexity in terms of big(O), etc. notation
2. Present the solution in a GUI form, where user can easily go to any step to see the state of the sudoku
   (At every step, the sudoku puzzle should be shown in a small grid (GUI), hiughlighting the numbers filled in this step.)
